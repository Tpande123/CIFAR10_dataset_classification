# Introduction: -

A CNN, consisting of 4 convolutional layers along with max pooling layers whose output is passed onto fully connected layers, has been implemented using the library Pytorch. This CNN is trained using the training images contained in the CIFAR10 dataset and then the accuracy of the CNN model is evaluated on the test images contained in the CIFAR10 dataset.


## Prerequirements for both the code files: -

1.) Jupyter Notebook or google collab.

2.) The CIFAR10 dataset is being imported here using the torchvision package.


## How to run the code: - 

1.) Open the jupyter notebook terminal(or upload and open in google collab) 

2.) Navigate to the folder where the zip file is extracted to and open the respective .ipynb file provided in their respective folder. The code and the output to that code will be visible.

3.) To rerun the whole notebook again, press kernel and press Restart and run all. (For jupyter notebook users)
